==> 08Using-compression-and-archiving-tools.txt <==
Compression Tools:

- Compression tools are used to compress one or
more files or an archive to save space.

#- gzip

This command creates a compressed file of each of the
files specified and adds .gz extension to the files.

- Example: 
#- gzip filename
#- ls or ll (check files after compression)

- To uncompress use:
#- gunzip filename
or
#- gzip -d filename
# ls or ll (check files after decompression) 

---

You can also use bzip2 and bunzip2

#- bzip2 filename
#- bunzip2 filename or bzip2 -d filename

---

Archiving tools: 

- tar (tape archive)command creates, appends, updates
lists and extracts files to and from a single file
called tar file (aka tarball)

Example: 

#- tar 

options:
-c (Creates a tarball)
-v (Verbose mode)
-f (Specifies a tarball name)
-t (Lists contents of a tarball)
-x (Extracts from a tarball)
-z (Compresses a tarball with gzip command)

#- tar cvf example.tar  example 
Creates tarball example.tar of the file example

#- tar tvf example.tar
To list contents of tarball example.tar

#- tar xvf example.tar
To extract file example.tar

#- tar cvzf example.tar.gz example
Creates a tarball and compresses it with gzip

#- tar xvzf example.tar.gzgzip
















==> 09Introduction-to-the-vi-editor.txt <==

- The vi editor is an interactive fullscreen visual 
text editing tool that lets you create and modify 
text files.
It is available in all Linux didtributions.
It is an essential tool for Linux users and admins.

#- vi filename 
If the filename exists it will open it, otherwise it
will create a new file with specified filename.

- Once the file is open use below examples:

Example1: type i (go in insert mode to insert 
characters) to edit or make changes to the file.

Example2: 
- Esc (to get out of insert mode)
- :
- wq! to save file
or q! to quit without saving

==> 12File-Types.txt <==
- Linux (Currently using RHEL 7.4 distro) supports 
several different types of files.

Some of the common file types are listed below: 
- Regular files
- Directory files
- Executable files
- Symbolic link files
- Device files


- Regular files:

Regular files may contain text or binary data. These
files could be command in the binary form or shell
scripts.
Examples:
#- ls /bin
#- file .bash_profile


- Directory files: 

Directories are logical containers that are used to 
hold files and sub-directories.
Examples:
#- ll / 
Letter d at the begining identifies the file as a 
directory.
#- file /
Identifies / as a directory


- Executable Files: 
Any file that can be run is an executable, they could 
be shell scripts or binary commands.
Examples: 
#- ll /usr/bin (x means it is executable)
#- file /usr/bin/whoami (executable command)


- Symbolic link files(aka symlink or softlink): 

These can be considered as a shortcut to another file 
or directory. Begins with letter l and shows an arrow.

Examples: 
#- ll /usr/sbin/vigr
l = soft link
-> = point to original file

#- file /usr/sbin/vigr



- Device Files: 

Each piece of hardware in the system has an associated
file called device file. 
Two types of device files are: 
- character (or raw) device file,(keybord)
- block device file

Examples: 
#- ll /dev/sda 
#- ll /dev/tty
First character b represents block device file
First character c represents character device file.

#- file /dev/sda
#- file /dev/tty













 


















































==> 13Creating-Files-and-Directories.txt <==
- Files can be create in multiple ways. However, 
directories can only be created with one command.

- Creating File with touch command: 
Examples: 
#- touch file1
#- ls
#- touch file2 file3 file4
#- ls
Note : If the file already exists, it will update the
timestamp on it to the current date and time.


- Creating files with vi editor: 
Examples: 
#- vi filename
- add text
- save and exit 


- Creating directories using mkdir command:
Examples: 
#- mkdir dir1
To create a directory called dir1

#- mkdir a b c 
To create 3 directories a b c.

#- mkdir -p 1/2/3
To create hierarchy of sub-directories.


==> 14Listing-Files-and-Directories.txt <==
- Use ll command to list files and directories.

#- ll 

drwxr-xr-x. 3 root root 15 May  9 20:50 1

Break down by Columns: 

Column 1: drwxr-xr-x. 
First charcter indicates a directory, next 9 characters
indicate permissions.

Column 2: 3
Displays the number of links.

Column 3: root
Shows the owner name.

Column 4: root
Displays the owning group name.

Column 5: 15
Identifies the file size in bytes. For directories
this number reflects the number of blocks being used
by directory to hold info about its contents.

Column 6,7 and 8:  May  9 20:50 1
Displays month, day of month and last modified time.

Column 9: 1
Name of the file or directory.

==> 15Displaying-File-Contents-with-cat-less-more-and-tail.txt <==
- Linux offers several tools for showing file contents.
Directory contents are simply the files and sub-
directories that it contains.

- Using the cat command: 
Examples: 
#- cat /etc/profile
Displays the contents of the file profile.


- Using more and less command: 

Examples: 
#- more /etc/profile

Displays long text files one page at a time, starting
at the beginning.

- Use spacebar to scroll forward one screen at a time.
- Use Enter to scroll one line at a time.


#- less /etc/profile

Similar to more command but offers some extended
capabilities, it is also faster than more as it does
not need to read the entire file before it starts to
show.


- Using head and tail commands: 

Examples:
#- head /etc/profile
By default it shows first 10 lines of the file.

#- head -3 /etc/profile
This will show only the first 3 lines of a file.


#- tail /etc/profile
By default it shows last 10 lines of the file.

#- tail -3 /etc/profile
This will show only the last 3 lines of a file.








==> 16Copying-Directories-and-Files.txt <==
- The copy operation duplicates a file or a directory.

- Use cp command to copy files and directories:
Example: 
#- cp file1 newfile1
To copy file1 to newfile1
#- ls


- If the file already exists it gets over written by
default, use -i option if you want a confirmation
before over writing the file.

Example: 
#- cp -i file1 newfile1


#- cp -r dir1 dir2
Copy a directory recursively.
#- ls



==> 17Moving-Renaming-Directories-and-Files.txt <==
- Moving and renaming files: 

Move "mv" command is used to rename or move files.

- Moving and renaming files: 
Examples:

#- mv file1 file2
To move or rename a file.

#- mv -i file1 file2
If file2 already exists use -i for confirmation.


- Moving and renaming Directories: 
Examples:

#- mv dir1 dir2
To move or rename a directory.








==> 18Removing-Directories-and-Files.txt <==
- Removing Files

#- rm file1
Remove file.

#- rm -i file2
To remove file with confirmation.

#- rm -f file
To remove file forcefully (no confirmation).




- Removing directories: 

#- rmdir dir1
To delete an empty directory.

#- rm -r dir1
To delete a non empty directory recursively. 

$- rm -rf dir1
To remove a directory recursively and forcefully.





==> 19Finding-Files.txt <==
- Typical running Linux system has hundreds and 
thousands of files. You may need to search for a files
by a particular user or search file by their size.

- Using the find command
#- find / -name fi* -print

find = command
/ = Path or location we want to search
name = search option (search by name)
print = action (print is default so no need to type it)
delete = action

Example: 

- Find all files named "file1": under / directory
and delete them all: 

#- find / -name files
#- find / -name files -delete
#- #- find / -name files
find / -perm -4000


- Find files smaller than 1 MB in root's home directory
#-  find / -size -1M

- Find files smaller than 1 MB in current directory.
#-  find . -size -1M
"." represents current directory


- To find files in /usr, larger than 40MB
#- find /usr -size +40M


- Find files that were modified 4 days ago:
#- find /var -mtime 4

#- man find 
To learn more about find command.

 








==> 20Soft-and-hard-links.txt <==
- Linking files and directories

-Before looking at soft and hard links, let's look at
some basics that you must understand:


- Let's look at the result of below command: 

#- ll /usr/sbin/vigr 

lrwxrwxrwx. 1 root root 4 Dec 20 06:10 /usr/sbin/vigr 
-> vipw

- Each file in a system has many attributes assigned to 
it at the time of its creation known as metadata. These
include file's type, size, permissions, owners name
owners group name, ACL, links and other related info.

This metadata info has to be stores somewhere.
This metadata info takes only 128-bytes of space and
this tiny storage space is knows as inode (index node)
Inode assigns a numeric identifier to each file which 
is used by the kernel.


To find out inode number of a file use below command:

#- ll -i /usr/sbin/vigr 

99699 lrwxrwxrwx. 1 root root 4 Dec 20 06:10 
/usr/sbin/vigr -> vipw

99699 = inode number

--------


- Soft and hard links

- Soft links (aka symlink or symbolic link):  

Soft links are similar to a short cut in windows, they 
point to another file. 

Example: 
- Create a soft link called file2 to an existing
file called file1: 

#- ln -s file1 file2
#- ll file2
lrwxrwxrwx. 1 root root 5 May 10 15:34 file2 -> file1

l = soft link
-> = points to the linked file


- Show inodes of both files:
#- ll -i file*
Inodes assigned to both files are different.

Note: If the original file is deleted symlink becomes 
useless as it is a shortcut to a file that does not
exist.

----

- Hard link: 

Hard link associates one or more files with a single
inode number unlike a softlink.
This also implies that any changes made to original 
file will also be applied to the hard linked file.


Example: 

- Create a hard link called file2 to an existing 
file called file1. 

#- ln file1 file2
#- ll -i file*

200622 -rw-r--r--. 2 root root 0 May 10 15:34 file1
200622 -rw-r--r--. 2 root root 0 May 10 15:34 file2

As you can see both files have the same inode number.
200622 is the inode number
2 represents number of hard links

Note: If one file is deleted the other file will 
exist unlike a symlink.




































==> 21Understanding-File-and-Directory-Permissions.txt <==
- Understanding permissions

Let's look at permissions of file1 and file2:

#- ll file1 and ll file2
-rwx-w---x. 1 root root 0 May 10 15:34 file1
-rwxrwxrwx. 1 root root 0 May 10 16:18 file2
	

r = read
w = write
x = execute

u = user owner
g = group owner
o = others (or public)








==> 22Modifying-File-Permissions.txt <==
- Modifying permissions

Let's look at permissions of file1:

#- ll file1 and ll file2
-rwx-w---x. 1 root root 0 May 10 15:34 file1
-rwxrwxrwx. 1 root root 0 May 10 16:18 file2
	

r = read
w = write
x = execute

u = user owner
g = group owner
o = others (or public)

r = read     = 4
w = write    = 2
x = execute  = 1
rwx   =	       7 

rwx-w---x     and  rwxrwxrwx
7   2   1	   7   7   7

- Change rights of a file and grant full rights to 
user, group and others through octal notations.
#- ll
#- chmod 777 file
#- ll

- Change rights of a file - remove read, write and
execute rights for group and others via symbolic
notation.

#- chmod go-rw file
#- ll file 

To re-add read and write rights back to group & 
others:
#- chmod go+rw
$- ll file

- Assign read rights to all users
#- chmod a=rwx
a = all









==> 23Defualt-Permissions-and-umask.txt <==
Linux assigns default permissions to a file or a
directory at the time of creation. 

Default permissions are calculated based on the 
umask (user mask)permission value subtracted from a 
preset value called "initial" permissions.

Default permission = umask - initial


Example: 
Create a file as a regular user 
#- touch file
#- ll
-rw-rw--r--. 1 root root 0 May 10 17:04 file
6   6   4

readwrite-readwrite--read-- (default permissions)


- To find umsak value:
#- umask
002
umask can be changed using sudo vi /etc/profile
For regular users: 
- Initial permissions = 666 for files 
- Initial permissions = 777 for directories 
Files: 
- Initial permissions - umask = Default permission  
  666 - 002 = 664

-rw-rw--r--. 1 root root 0 May 10 17:04 file
6   6   4

Directories: 
- Initial permissions - umask = Default permission
  777 - 002 = 775
Example: 
#- mkdir 2 (as regular user)
#- ll 2
drwxrwxr-x. 2 1 1 6 May 10 17:20 2
7  7   5
 

 
==> 24Modify-File-Ownership-and-Group-Membership.txt <==
- Create a file.

#- touch file

ll file

- Create a user user1
#- useradd user1

- Change ownership of file to user1
#- chown user1 file
#- ll file

- Change group ownership of file to user1
#- chgrp user1 file
#- ll file

- Create user2
#- useradd user2

- Assign both ownership and owning group to user2
for file1
#- chown user2:user2 file
#- ll file


- Assign both ownership and owning group to user2
for a directory Recursively:
#- chown -R user2:user2 directory

==> 25Special-Permissions-setuid-setgid-and-sticky-bit.txt <==
- Linux offers 3 types of special permission bits that
maybe set on executable files or directories to 
respond differently for certain operations.

These special permission bits are:

- setuid (set user identifier) bit
- setgid (set group identifier) bit
- sticky bit


- The setuid and setgid:

- These 2 bits can provide non-owners and non-group 
owners the ability to run executables with same access
as the owner and group owner.


- Setuid bit on executable files:

Setuid bit flag can provide regular users the ability 
to run the same access as the owner of the executable 
file.
It is represented by an s in the owner's permission
class. 

Example: 
#- ll /usr/bin/su
-rwsr-xr-x. 1 root root 32096 Dec  1 18:28 /usr/bin/su
s = setuid bit

- Login with a regular user and run su command.

- Lets remove the setuid flag 
#- chmod u-s /usr/bin/su
#- ll /usr/bin/su
-rwxr-xr-x. 1 root root 32096 Dec  1 18:28 /usr/bin/su

Setuid bit has been removed, let try to run su again 
as a regular user.
su: Authentication failure

- To re-add setuid bit:
#- chmod u+s /usr/bin/su
#- ll /usr/bin/su
-rwsr-xr-x. 1 root root 32096 Dec  1 18:28 /usr/bin/su
re-added setuid bit represented by s.

- You can also use numbers to apply setuid bit.
#- chmod u+s /usr/bin/su
or 
#- chmod 4755 /usr/bin/su

4 adds the the setuid bit.

- To search for all files with setuid bit permissions:
#- find / -perm -4000

------------

Setgid bit on executable files:

- Setgid bit is set on executable files at the group 
level. Setgid bit flag can provide regular users the 
ability to run the same access as the group members of 
the executable file.
It is represented by an s in the group's permission
class. 

Example: 
#- ll /usr/bin/wall
-r-xr-sr-x. 1 root tty 15344 Jun  9  2014 /usr/bin/wall
s is the stickybit flag in group permissions


To remove setgid bit: 
#- chmod g-s /usr/bin/wall

To add setgid bit: 
#- chmod g+s /usr/bin/wall
 or 
#- chmod 2555 /usr/bin/wall


- To search for all files with setgid bit permissions:
#- find / -perm -2000

-------------

- Stickybit: 

Sticky bit is set on public writeable directories to 
prevent moving or deletion by regular users.

Example: 

#- ll -d /tmp
drwxrwxrwt. 7 root root 93 May 11 04:00 /tmp/

t = stickybit in other's permissions


- The stickybit can be set by following command:
- Create a directory
#- mkdir dir1

-Add stickybit with rwx permissions to all
#- chmod o+t /tmp
#- chmod 777 /tmp
or
#- chmod 1777
#- ll dir1

- To remove stickybit
#- chmod o-t dir1
or
#- chmod 777 dir1

1 sets the sticky bit.

- To search for all files with stickybit permissions:
#- find / -type d -perm -1000





























==> 26Introduction-to-the-Bash-Shell.txt <==
- Bash (bourne again shell) Shell: 

The shell is referred to as the command interpreter
and it is an interface between a user and the kernel.

Shell accepts instructions from users (or srcipts), 
interprets them and passes them on to kernel for 
processing. 
Kernel then utilizes all hardware and software 
components required for successfully processing the
instructions. 

RHEL/Centos supports several shells of which bash shell
is the most popular.

It is also the default shell in RHEL7. Bash shell 
provides variety of features such as variable 
manipulation, command substitution, input and output
redirection, command history, tab completion, tilde
substitution, pattern matching, metacharacters, command
aliasing, quoting, conditional execution, flow control
and shell scripting. 

The bash shell is identified by $ sign for regular 
users and the # for root user. This Shell is resident 
in /bin/bash file.







==> 27Variables.txt <==
- Variables: 

- A variable is a temporary storage of data in memory.
Stored information is used for customizing the shell
environment and by many system and application processes
to function properly. 

- There are 2 types of variables: local and environment.

-The value of a local variable is only available in the
current shell and not in the sub-shell.

- The value of an environment variable can be passed 
from current to sub-shell during the execution of a
script. Which means value stored in an environment
variable is passed from the parent process to the child
process. 

- Some environment variables are defined automatically
through system and user startup files at log in such as:

DISPLAY  - stores hostname or IP for X terminal
HISTFILE - Define files for storing history of commands
HOME     - Sets the home directory path
LOGNAME  - Stores the login name
PWD      - Stores the current directory location
SHELL    - Holds the absolute path to primary shell file


Setting an Unsetting Varaiables and View their Values

-Local and environment variables may be set or unset at
the command prompt or via programs, and their values
may be viewed and used as necessary. 

-Uppercase letters for naming variables are recommended
to avoid any possible conflicts with existing command,
program, file or directory names.

Examples: 

- Define a local variable called VR1:
$- VR1=rhel7

- To view the stored value in VR1: 
$- echo $VR1

To make this variable an environment variable: 

$- export VR1

- To undefine this variable: 

$- unset VR1


- Define a local variable with white spaces:

$- VR1="This is a Test"

echo $VR1

- set command lists current values for all shell 
variables, including local and environment variables.


- To modify primary prompt for a user :
$- export PS1="<$LOGNAME@$(hostname):\$PWD>"

- Command prompt for user 1 now looks like: 

<1@centos:/home/example>































==> 28Input-Output-and-Error-Redirection.txt <==
- The bash shell gives us the flexibility to redirect
input, output, and error messages. 

This allows programs and commands to read input from a
non-default source and forward output or errors to a 
non-default destination.



- Redirecting standard Input:

Input redirection instructs a command to read the
required information from a file instead of the keyboard
The '<' (less than) character is used for input 
redirection.

- Redirecting standard input: 
Example:

#- cat < /etc/cron.allow 

--------

- Redirecting standard Output '>' (greater than sign):

Output redirection sends the output generated by a
command to an alternative destination. The > sign is
is used for this purpose. You can redirect the output
to file with the  > sign to overwite the mentioned
file or append to it by using >> signs.

Example: 

- Redirecting standard output to a file:

#- ll > file2 
 or 
#- ll >> file2 (to append)

#- cat file2

--------

- Redirecting standard error:

Error redirection forwards an error messages generated
to an alternative destination - such as a file.

-Example:

#- find / -name core -print 2> /dev/null

This command will find all occurences of files by the
name core in the entire root directory and send any 
errors to /dev/null (/dev/null is used to discard data).



- Redirecting both standard output and error: 
Following example shows you how to forward both error
and standard output to a file.

- Example: 

#- ls /nothing &> test

There is no file or directory called nothing so the 
the ls command will run, produce an error and send it
to a file called test. 

Note: Test file will be created if it does not already 
exist.

#- cat test






























==> 29Command-History.txt <==
Command History: 

Command History keeps a log of all commands that you 
run at the command prompt. This feature is enabled by
default. Bash shell stores command history in a file
located in user's home directory.

- Following command can tell you where the command
history file is located.

#- echo $HISTFILE

/root/.bash_history

- HISTSIZE variable controls max number of command
enries that can be that can be stored in HISTFILE.

#- echo $HISTSIZE

---

- Let's look at the history command examples:

#- history
#- history | more


- To re-execute a command: 
#- !60
This will re-run the command on line number 60.


- To re-run the last executed command:
#- !!


- Using the up arrow key: 

Also shows you previously typed in commands.











==> 30Tilde-Substitution.txt <==
- Tilde Substitution:

Also knows as tilde expansion is performed on words
that begin with the tilde ~ character.

- If ~ is used as a standalone character, it refers to
the home directory of the user running the command.

Let's look at some examples: 

Examples: 

#- echo ~
Refers to home directory of current user.


#- ls ~
 List contents of home directory

#- echo ~+

Echo current directory - similar to PWD

#- echo ~-

Refers to previous working directory

#- echo ~username

Refers to home directory of the specified user.


Note: It can be used with any commands such as cd, ls
and echo.


==> 31Regular-expression-GREP.txt <==
Regular Expression:

Also refered to as pattern matching, regex or regexp.
To keep it simple you can just refer to it as pattern
matching for now.

Pattern can be a character, series of characters, word
or sentences.

- grep (global regular expansion print): 
Linux provides a powerful tool called grep for pattern 
matching. 
The grep tool searches contents of one or more text 
files or supplied input for a regular expression. If the 
expression is matched it prints every line containing
that expression on the screen.

Example: 

#- grep test /etc/passwd
#- grep 1000 /etc/passwd

Test is the expression that you are searching for in
/etc/passwd file.

#- grep nologin /etc/passwd
Search for nologin

#- grep -v nologin /etc/passwd
To exclude nologin

#- grep -nv nologin /etc/passwd
To exclude nologin and number the lines found


#- grep ^root /etc/passwd
To search for any lines that begin with root.
Caret sign ^ marks the beginning of a line or word.

#- grep ^$ /etc/passwd
To search for all empty lines in /etc/passwd


#- grep -i root /etc/passwd
To perform case-insensitive search for root in a file.
i = case insensitive 

#- cat  /etc/passwd  | egrep 'test|root'
Searches for patterns test and root in /etc/passwd.

| (pipe) can send output of one command as input to 
the next. More on pipe in the next section.














==> 32Metacharacters-Wild-Cards-Pipe (1).txt <==
Metacharacters: 

These are special characters that possess special
meaning to the shell. They are output redirection <>,
caret^, $, ., *, ?, []square brackets, pipe |, curly
brackets {}, parantheses (), \, +. 

We will cover some of these in this section.


The * character: 

Asterisk matches zero to unlimited number of characters

Example: 

#- ls /etc/ali*
To list all files that begin with ali in /etc.

#- ls /var/log/*.log
To search for in /var/log for files ending with .log.


----

The ? character:
Question mark character matches exactly one character,
except for a leading period in a hidden file.

Example:
 
#- ls -d /var/???
To search for directories with exactly 3 characters in
their names.

----

The [] character:
Square brackets can be used to match either a set of
characters or range characters.

Examples:

#- ls /usr/sbin/[wz]*
To ls all files that begin with with either of the two
characters wz in /usr/sbin.


#- ls /usr/sbin/[w-z]*
To ls all files that begin with any letter between w 
and z.


-------

The | (pipe) character:

Pipe is represented by the vertical bar |, residing
with the \(backslash) on the keyboard, is used to send
output of one command as input to the next.

Example: 

#- ll /etc | more

#- ll /etc | grep fstab

#- who | nl
nl = number each line

#- cat -n /etc/passwd | grep 26

Find line 26 in /etc/passwd















==> 33Your-first-bash-script-hello-world.txt <==
Shell Script:

Shell script is just a simple text file with ".sh" 
extension, having executable permission.

For example: firstscript.sh



Writing and executing a script:

- Create a file in your current directory hello.sh.

# touch hello.sh

- Edit file:

# vi hello.sh

- Write script and save file.

#!/bin/bash
# My first script

echo "Hello World!"

wq!

- To clarify: 

#!/bin/bash = shebang (thats how the script starts)
# = Comment ( Does not execute anything)
echo "Hello World!" =  actual script



- Make the script executable:
# chmod 744 hello.sh


- Run the script:
# ./hello.sh


Output:
Hello World!













==> 34 Create+an+Interactive+script.txt <==
Create an interactive script:

- Create a file called interactive.sh
# touch interactive.sh

- Write below lines in script

#! /bin/bash
echo "What's Your First Name?";
read a;
echo "Welcome Mr. $a, What's your Last Name";
read b;
echo "Thanks Mr. $a $b for providing your name";
echo
echo "Mr. $b, Goodbye"

wq!

- Make the script executable
# chmod 755 interactive.sh

- Run script
# ./interactive.sh




==> 35 User+Authentication+Files.txt <==
- Types of users served by the authentication files: 

Linux supports three types of user accounts: root, 
normal and serice.


- The root user: 
The root User is the superuser or administrator with 
full access to all services, administrative functions 
and  possesses full powers on the system.
This user is automatically created during Linux 
installation. 

- The normal user:
The normal users have user-level previlages. They cannot 
perform any administrative functions, but can run 
applications and programs that they are authorized to 
execute. 

- The service account: 

The service accounts are responsible for taking care of
the installed services. The service accounts include 
apache, ftp, mail, ntp, postfix and qemu.



- Authentication Files:

Account info for these users is stored in four files
located in the /etc directory.

These files are passwd, shadow, group and gshadow. These
files are updated when a user account is created, 
modified or deleted. 

These authentication files are referenced to check and 
validate the credentials when a user attempts to login.

These files are so important that the system keeps a
backup of each of these files as passwd-, shadow-, 
group- and gshadow- in /etc directory.

Example: 
#- ls /etc/shadow*
/etc/shadow  /etc/shadow-

- All four files will be covered in the next lectures.




































==> 36 The+passwd+File.txt <==
The passwd File: 

The /etc/passwd file contains important user login info.
Each line contains info for each user account.


There are 7 fields on each line separated by a colon :


Examples: 
#- grep root /etc/passwd
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash

- root, user and service accounts: 

#- grep test /etc/passwd
test:x:1000:1000:test:/home/test:/bin/bash

#- grep ntp /etc/passwd
ntp:x:38:38::/etc/ntp:/sbin/nologin

- Breakdown of the 7 fields: 

Field 1: User Name = root, test and ntp

Field 2: Password (stored in /etc/shadow) = x 
(If * instead of x, it means a disabled account)

Field 3: UID (User ID) = 0, 1000 and 38 (0 for root)

Field 4: GID (Group ID) = 0, 1000 and 38 
Represents user's primary group - entry in /etc/group.

Field 5: Comments = root, test and empty.

Field 6: Home Directory = /root, /home/test and /etc/ntp

Field 7: Default Shell = /bin/bash and /sbin/nologin

 












==> 37 The+shadow+File.txt <==
The shadow File: 

The implementation of shadow password mechanism provides
secure password security for local users.

With this mechanism in place not only user passwords are
are encrypted and stored in /etc/shadow file but limits
such as password expiration, warning period, etc., can
also be applied on a per-user basis.
#- cat /etc/shadow


These limits and other settings are defined in the
/etc/login.defs file and are enforced on user accounts.
The shadow file is only readable by the root user for 
security purposes.
#- grep -v ^# /etc/login.defs


If shadow password mechanism is active a user existence
is first checked in /etc/passwd and then in shadow for 
authentication.



Examples:

#- grep user /etc/shadow

test:$6$Mgwnh$.2ZrafQ::0:99999:7:::
root:$6$03YAalCcIBR1::0:99999:7:::
- There are 9 colon : separated fields per line entry.

1- Test = Username

2- Encrypted Password = $6$Mgwnh$.2ZrafQx
! sign at the beginning of line means account is locked

3- Blank = lastchg days (Date when pw was last modified)
Blank = pw aging not applied, 0 = Change pw at login.

4- 0 = minday (Min # of days before pw can be changed)

5- 99999 = maxdays (Max # of days of pw validity)

6- 7 = warndays 
Number of days a user gets Warning to change pw 

7- Blank = inactive days 
Max number or days allowed of user inactivity
Blank or null means feature is disabled

8- Blank - Disabled days 
Number of days before user account expires

9- Blank - Reserved for future use.





























==> 38 The+group+File.txt <==
The group File: 

This file contains the group info. Each row in the file
stores one group entry.

#- cat /etc/group
To view the file.

Every user in the system must be a member of atleast 
one group - refered to as the user's Primary group.

By default, a group name matches the username.

- For Example: 

By default 
Group name user1 will be the primary group of user1
Group name root will be the primary group of root user

This default group is known as User Private Group(UPG)
and it safeguards a user's files from other users.



- There are 4 fields per line separated by a colon :

Examples:

#- grep username /etc/group
user1:x:1004:
root:x:0:

Field 1: user1 = Group name 
Same as user name by default 

Field 2: x = Password Placeholder
x point to gshadow file for password

Field 3: 1004 = GID (group identifier or group ID)

By default groups are ceated with GID's starting at
1000. Several users can be part of one group and a
user can be part of multiple groups.

Field 4: Blank = Group members
Blank (if no members) as user's primary group is listed
in the /etc/passwd file and not the group file.































 
==> 39 The+gshadow+File.txt <==
- The gshadow File: 

The shadow password implemention provides an added layer
of security at the group level. 
With this mechanism active, the group passwords are 
encrypted and stored in a secure /etc/gshadow file, only
readable by the root user.

#- cat /etc/gshadow
To view gshadow as root

- This file stores encrypted group passwords. Each row
in file responds to one entry in the group file.

There are 4 fields per line, separated by a colon :

- Examples: 
#- grep username /etc/gshadow

root:::
test:!!::test
user1:!::

Field 1: test = Group Name(as it appears in /etc/group)

Field 2: !, !!, blank = Contains encrypted pw, ! or !!
- Encypted pw can be set with gpasswd command.
- Single ! disallows users access to this group with the
newgroup command.
- Pair of !! means same restriction as signle ! and it
also indicates that group pw has never been set.

Field 3: Blank = Group Admins
Lists group admins that can add/remove users to from 
this group with gpasswd command.

Field 4: Test and blank = Members
Users that belong to the group.







==> 40 pwck+and+vigr.txt <==
Integrity of Authentiction files: 


The pwck command verifies the integrity of the users and
authentication information. 
It checks that all entries in /etc/passwd and 
/etc/shadow have the proper format and contain valid 
data. The user is prompted to delete entries that are
improperly formatted or which have other uncorrectable
errors.

Example: 
#- pwck:
user 'ftp': directory '/var/ftp' does not exist
pwck: no changes




- Preventing Corruption in Authentication files: 

When an admin needs to edit passwd or the group file
manually, and if another user is changing his password 
at the same time - the admin changes to the file will
be lost. 
Command vigr or vipw locks the file so editing of the
files by another user by will be locked for that
duration.

The vipw and vigr commands edits the files /etc/passwd 
and /etc/group, respectively.
 
With the -s flag, they will edit the shadow versions
of those files:
/etc/shadow and /etc/gshadow, respectively. 

The programs will set the appropriate locks to prevent
file corruption.
 
When looking for an editor, the programs will first
try the environment variable $VISUAL, then the
environment variable $EDITOR, and finally the default
editor, vi.

[root@centos example]# vigr -s
vigr: Couldn't lock file: Interrupted system call
vigr: /etc/gshadow is unchanged

As the file is being edited either by a command or
via vigr so invoking another session generates the 
above error.







==> 41 Activating+and+Deactivating+Shadow+Password+Mechanism.txt <==
Activating and Deactivating Shadow Password Mechanism:

Shadow Password mechanism enables the use of shadow and
gshadow files for storing user and group passwords and
password aging info maybe deactivated if needed.
However, this is not recommended.

The activation tool reference the /etc/login.defs file
for some password aging attributes while being executed

Examples: 

- To activate password shadowing.
#- pwconv

This command executes silently without displaying any
output unless there is an iusse.
It creates the shadow file with read-only permissions
for the root user.

#- ll /etc/shadow


- To activate password shadowing at the group level.
#- grpconv

This command executes silently without displaying any
output unless there is an issue.

It creates the gshadow file with read-only permissions
for the root user.

#- ll /etc/gshadow



- To deactivate password shadowing and remove the
shadow file: 
#- pwunconv
 

- To deactivate password shadowing at the group level
and remove the shadow file: 
#- grpunconv








==> 42 Adding+Users+and+default+values.txt <==
- The useradd and login.defs:

The useradd command picks up the default values from the
/etc/default/useradd and /etc/login.defs files for any
options that are not specified at the command line.

The login.defs file is also consulted by the usermod, 
userdel, chage and passwd commands as needed.

- To view useradd file:

#- cat /etc/default/useradd
or
#- useradd -D


These default values can be modified as desired.


Example: 

- To change the default base directory to /usr/home as 
the home directory: 

#- useradd -D -b /usr/home

To confirm: 
#- useradd -D



- The other file /etc/login.defs comprises of additional
directives that set several defaults.

User and group management commands consult the file
/etc/login.defs to obtain info that is not specified at
the command line.


- Example: 

To view the file login.defs a grep is shown on the 
uncommented and non-empty lines use below command:

#- grep -v ^# /etc/login.defs | grep -v ^$

MAIL_DIR  /var/spool/mail

==> 43 The+passwd+command.txt <==
- The passwd command:

Passwd command is used to change the password of a user
account. 
A normal user can run passwd to change their own 
password.
Super user root or another user with root privilege can 
use passwd command to change another user's password, or 
define how that account's password can be used or 
changed.

 Examples:

- To change current logged-in user's password:
# passwd

- To change another user's password (as root): 
#- passwd username 

- Non-root user can also change another user's password
with sudo privileges: 
#- sudo passwd username


- Options for passwd command: 

Examples:
 
- To lock a user account: 
#- passwd -l username

- To Unlock a user account: 
#- passwd -u username


- To view other options see man pages: 
#- man passwd  




















==> 44 Creating+a+User+Account+with+Default+Values.txt <==
- Creating a User Account with Default Values: 

Examples: 


- Create user8 with all default values:
#- useradd user8



- Create a password for this user: 
#- passwd user8

#- cd /etc; grep user8 passwd shadow group gshadow



==> 45 Create+a+User+account+with+No+Login+Access.txt <==
- "No login" shell is primarily used for application 
accounts. As these accounts do not require login access
to the system. 



- To create a user123 with shell file /sbin/nologin:
#- useradd -s /sbin/nologin user123


- Check if the shell is assigned correctly: 
#- grep user123 /etc/passwd



- Try to login to make sure login is denied.
#- su user123


Note: 
The nologin shell can also be assigned to a regular
user to disable access temporarily.

==> 46 Password+Aging+on+User+accounts.txt <==
- Configure password aging for user123.


#- passwd -n 7 -x 28 -w 5 user123

-n = mindays = 7 - 
Minimum number of days between password change.

-x = maxdays = 28
Maximum number of days between password change.

-w = warndays = 5
Number of days of warning before password expires.



- Confirm new settings with the chage command:
#- chage -l user123


#- man passwd



==> 47 Modify+and+Delete+a+User+Account.txt <==
- Delete a User Account

- To remove user123 along with home and mail spool 
directories: 
#- userdel -r user123

- Confirm user1 deletion:
#- grep user123 /etc/passwd

or 

#- id user123


Modify a user account: 

- Modify user1's login name from user1 to usernew, UID 
to 2000, home directory to /home/usernew and login shell 
to /sbin/nologin:

#- usermod -u 2000 -m -d /home/usernew -s /sbin/nologin
-l usernew user1

- Confirm changes
#- grep usernew /etc/passwd

- Set Dec 29, 2018 as the newexpiry date for usernew:
#- usermod -e 2018-12-29 usernew

- Confirm changes: 
#- chage -l usernew





==> 48 Switching+users.txt <==
Switching Users: 

Logging in to the system directly as root is not 
recommended. The recommended practice is to log on with 
normal user account and then switch into the root 
account if necessary.

In addition to becoming root, we can also switch into 
another user account. Unless you are root, you need to
know the password for the target user account you are
switching to.

The su command can used to switch into another user
account.

Example: 

- To switch from a user to root without executing 
startup scripts for the target user:
#- su
Password (root pw)



- To switch into a different user account from user1
to user2, specify the name of the target user with the
command: 
#- su - user2
Password (user2 password)


- You can also issue a command as a different user 
without switching into that user: 

#- su -c 'firewall-cmd --list-services'
Password (root password)

-c option is available with su.
- firewall-cmd --list-services requires superuser
privileges.
- users can use su to execute privileged commands. 


- User root can switch into any account without being
prompted for that user's password.

#- su user1



















==> 49 The+sudo+utility.txt <==
The sudo utility: 

Linux gives normal users the ability to run privileged
commands. There is a utility called sudo that can be 
used for this purpose.


- For example, a regular user can run useradd command 
with sudo if they have been granted access: 
#- sudo useradd
password


- Rights provided to sudo users can be used to allow
a user or a group to run scripts and applications
owned by a different user.


- Rights an be provided by editing a file /etc/sudoers.
- File can be edited by using visudo command.

- To give ALL privileges to administrative commands on 
the system to both a user called test and a group 
called wheel, add the below line to /etc/sudoers file: 

test    ALL=(ALL)      ALL
%wheel  ALL=(ALL)      ALL


- To give access to users and groups so they can run 
privileged commands without getting prompted for a
password, below lines can be added to sudoers file.

test    ALL=(ALL)    NOPASSWD: ALL
%wheel  ALL=(ALL)    NOPASSWD: ALL


- Rights can also be granted to users and groups in 
a restricted way:

user	All=/usr/sbin/userdel,/usr/sbin/adduser
%wheel	All=/usr/sbin/userdel,/usr/sbin/adduser

- Add user2 and user3 as members of the linuxadm
group: 

#- gpasswd -a user2 -a user3 linuxadm



- Create user4 with default values and assign 
password = user123: 

#- useradd user4 ; echo user123 | passwd --stdin 
user4



- Substitute user2 and user3 with user4 as a
member of the linuxadm group: 

#- gpasswd -M user4 linuxadm




- Set a password on the linuxadm group:

#- gpasswd linuxadm

group membership for user4:

#- groups













==> 52 User+and+System+Shell+Startup+Files.txt <==
- System-wide Shell startup files: 

System-wide startup files set the general environment
for all users at the time of their login to the 
system. These files are:

- /etc/bashrc: 
Defines functions and aliases, sets the umask value, 
the command prompt, etc. It includes settings from
the shell scripts located in the /etc/profile.d
directory.

- /etc/profile: 
Sets environment variables such as PATH, USER, MAIL,
LOGNAME, HOSTNAME, HISTSIZE and HISTCONTROL for users
and startup programs. Also processes shell scripts
located in /etc/profile.d directory.


- /etc/profile.d: 
Contains scripts for bash and C shell users that are
executed by /etc/profile file. Additional scripts 
can be created here for further enviroment changes.

#- cat /etc/bashrc
#- cat /etc/profile
#- ll /etc/profile.d




- Per-user Shell startup files: 

These files override or modify default system-wide
settings. Individual users can customize these files
to suit their needs. These get copied into user's
home directory at the time of their creation.

Per-user startup files for bash shell users:

~/.bashrc:
Defines functions and aliases. This file sources
global definitons from /etc/bashrc file.

~/.bashrc_profile:
Sets environment variables. This file sources the
~/.bashrc file to set functions and aliases.

==> 53 What+is+SSH.txt <==
https://www.tecmint.com/protect-ssh-logins-with-ssh-motd-banner-messages/

 Introduction to SSH Secure Shell: 

Secure Shell SSH provides a secure mechanism for data
transmission between source and destination systems over
IP networks. 

It replaces older remote login programs that transmitted
user password in clear text(Telnet) and unencrypted data.

SSH uses encryption for secure communication and digital
signatures for user authentication.

It also ensures integrity of the data being transfered.

SSH includes a set of utilities and provides remote 
users the ability to login, transfer files and securely
execute commands. 

SSH utilities have widely replaced other unsecure login
and file transfer programs.

SSH operates over port 22, unless you configure it
otherwise. 

Example: 

#- ssh servername (test)

#- man ssh

==> 54 When+is+SSH+used.txt <==
When is SSH used?


Most servers are located in data centers or equipment 
racks far away from the system admins and users.


Same is true for routers, switches and other network
devices.


In most cases it's not practical to physically visit the
console of each server that you manage, so instead we
install SSH clients susch as PuTTY or TeraTerm on
Windows computers or OpenSSH on Macs and nix computers.


We can then use such software to log in across the
network to the remote servers and other network devices.


That is how system administrators manage servers from 
the command line as though they were actually sitting
at the physical console.


==> 55How+to+configure+SSH.txt <==
How to configure SSH?

Once SSH is installed, configuration file is located in
/etc/ssh/sshd_config.


Within this file you can modify things such as:

-The listening IP adress
-TCP Port number (Default is 22)
-Logging options
-Authentication options


Before making any changes to this file make sure to 
make a backup of the original file for safety.

Example:

#:- cat /etc/ssh/sshd_config

==> 56 Securing+SSH.txt <==
Securing SSH:

From security standpoint, there are two easy things to
do to make SSH secure:

1- Change the default port:

The default port is 22, but its easy to change it to
something else within the dynamic port range of
49,153 to 65,535. 

A hacker running a system wide port scan can still 
discover it but it is better than having port 22 as a
default which almost everyone knows.

Usually hackers are looking for easy targets and they
move on to an easier target if it takes too long.


2- Disable root login:

On most internet connected servers, usually logs will
indicate tons of attempts using username root by the
bad guys.
Everyone knows Linux admin username is root so they will
try to penetrate the system with that username first.

Example:
- Make a backup of sshd_config
- vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
- Change port 22 to 5000
- Change PermitRootLogin from yes to no

Note: Now you will have to login with a regular user
instead of root via SSH.
 
==> 57 Transferring+Files+with+scp+and+sftp.txt <==
Transferring Files with SCP:

SCP stand for secure copy and is a part of SSH suite.
It allows you to transfer a file securely from one
server to another.

Example: 

#: scp file1 root@servername:/
To copy file1 from current location to another server
under the directory /.

Note: You don't need to specify the user name if logging
in with the same username.



Connecting through sftp: 

SFTP is installed as part of the SSH suite. 
It allows secure transfer of files as well as secure
authentication. Like SSH, SFTP also operates on the
same port 22.

Example:

#: sftp servername




==> 58 Configure+Private-Public+Key-Based+Authentication.txt <==
Configure Private-Public Key-Based Authentication:

In this example you will generate private/public key
combination for a user on one server and use it to 
allow this user to access another server using the ssh
command.

1- log onto centos (server name)
2- ssh-keygen
3- cat /home/user1/.ssh/id_rsa
4- ssh-copy-id -i id_rsa.pub test(server name)
5- ssh test as user2


==> 59 The+OpenSSH+Service.txt <==
OpenSSH is a free and open source implementation of SSH.
Once applied on the system - telnet, rlogin, rsh, rexec,
and ftp services can be disabled to enhance security.

The ssh command has replaced telnet, rlogin, rsh, rexec
and rcp,ftp commands have been replaced by scp, sftp
respectively. 



Example: 

- To transfer files securely from source to destination:

#- scp  /file1  servername:/file1

#- ssh user@servername

#- man ssh

 ssh (SSH client) is a program for logging into a
 remote machine and for executing commands on a remote
 machine.  It is intended to provide secure encrypted
 communications between two untrusted hosts over an
 insecure network.  X11 connections, arbitrary TCP
 ports and UNIX-domain sockets can also be forwarded
 over the secure channel.

==> 60 OpenSSH+Versions+and+Algorithms.txt <==
OpenSSH currently supports 2 versions: v1 and v2. Both 
are available in RHEL/Centos 7.
Newer version should used as it has enhanced features 
and configuration options.

Configuration file is located in /etc/ssh/sshd_config.

#- cat /etc/ssh/sshd_config

Check for installed ssh packages:

#- rpm -qa | grep ssh.


- Both versions support various algorithms for data 
encryption and user authentication (digital signatures).

OpenSSH v1: 
Supports the RSA Algorithm only.

OpenSSH v2: 
Supports RSA, DSA and ECDSA.

RSA:
Rivest-Shamir-Adleman, who first published this
Algorith.
RSA is most commonly used becuase it supports both
encryption and digital signatures.

DSA: 
Digital Signature Algorithm

ECDSA:
Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm.

==> 61 Encryption.txt <==
Encryption is a way of transforming information into a 
scrambled form to conceal the real informtion from 
unauthorized access. 

Encryption is done at the client end and the reverse
process is de-encryption, which is on the server end.

OpenSSH uses many encryption techniques during an end 
to end communication session.

These techniques include symmetric and asymmetric
encryption. 


- Symmetric Encryption: 

This type of encryption uses a single secret key or a
pair of keys to protect authentication traffic as well
as the entire communication session. 
This key is generated as a result of a negotiation 
process between the client and server.


- Asymmetric Encryption:

This encryption uses a private/public key combination
for encryption. These keys are randomly generated
alphanumeric characters attached to messages during a
communication session. 

The client transfers the information using a public key
and the server decrypts it using the paired private key.

The private key must be kept secure since it is private
to that one system only. The public key is distributed
to clients. 

This method is used for channel encryption as well as 
for user authentication. 






==> 62 Authentication+Methods.txt <==
Once an encrypted channel is established between the 
client and server, additional negotiations take place
between the two to authenticate the user trying to gain
acces to the server. 


Open SSH offers several methods for this purpose, listed 
below in the order in which they are attempted during
the authentication process:

- GSSAPI - based authentication
- Host based authentication
- Private/Public key based authentication
- Challenge response authentication
- Password based authentication


GSSAPI - based authentication: 

It provides a standard interface that allows security
mechanism such as Kerberos to be plugged in. OpenSSH
uses this interface and kerberos for authentication.

With this method, an exchange of tokens takes place
between the client and server to validate user identity.

This method is only supported in OpenSSH version 2.


Host based authentication: 

Allows a single user, a group of users or all users on
the client to be authenticated on the server.
A user may be configured to login with a matching user
name on the server or as a differnt user that exists on
the server.
Each user that requires an automatic entry on the server
a .shosts file is set up in the user's home directory.

Group of users or all users setup is done in the 
/etc/ssh/shosts.equiv file.



Private/Public key based authentication:

This method uses a private/public key combination for
user authentication. The user on the client has a public
key and the server stores the corresponding private key.

When user tries to login, the server prompts the user to
enter the key and lets the user login if the key is
validated.


Challenge response authentication: 

This method is based on response to one or more 
challenge questions that the user has to answer 
correctly in order to gain login access to the server.


Password based authentication:

Server prompts the user to enter their password. It
checks the password against the stored entry in the
/etc/shadow file and allows the user to login if the 
password is confirmed.





















==> 63OpenSSH+Packages.txt <==
OpenSSH has three packages that are of interest. 

These are:
 
- openssh
- openssh clients
- openssh server

openssh: 

The openssh package provides the ssh-keygen command and
some supported library routines. 


openssh clients: 

This package include commands such as scp, ftp, slogin,
ssh and ssh-copy-id and a client configuration file 
/etc/ssh/ssh_config. 


openssh server: 

This package contains the sshd daemon, a server 
configuration file /etc/ssh/sshd_config and library
routines.

By default openssh-server package is installed during
OS installation, which allows user to login using the
ssh command.
==> 64 Viewing+and+Monitoring+Processes.txt <==
Viewing and Monitoring Processes:

An operational system can have hundreds or thousands of
running processes depending on its purpose.

We can view and monitor these processes using various
native tools such as ps (process status) and top.


- The ps command: 

Shows basic process information in four cloumns.

Example: 

The ps command without any options or arguments lists
processes specific to the terminal where this command
is run.

#: ps

 PID TTY          TIME CMD
12034 pts/0    00:00:00 bash
12749 pts/0    00:00:00 ps

Above output shows basic information in four columns.

PID = process ID number.
TTY = Terminal the process belongs to.
TIME = Cumulative time CPU has given to this process.
CMD = Name of command or program being executed. 


Commonly used options with ps command include:
-a = all
-e = every
-f = full-format
-F = Extra full format
-l = long format


Example: 


#: ps -eaf

UID = User ID or process owner's name.
PID = Process ID number.
PPID = Process ID of the parent process.
C    = Processor utiliztion for the process.
STIME = Process start date or time.
TTY = Terminal the process belongs to.
TIME = Aggregated execution time for the process.
CMD = Name of command or program being executed.

Information of each running process is maintained and
kept in the /proc file system.



- The top command: 
Another popular tool for viewing process info is the
top command.
It displays the statistics in real-time helps to 
identify performance issues on the system.

Example: 

#: top

press q or ctrl c to quit top.


PID – Process ID
USER – Name of the effective user (owner) of the 
process.
PR – Priority
NI – Nice value
VIRT – virtual memory size
RES – resident memory size
SHR – shared memory size
S – process status (which could be one of the 
following: D (uninteruptible sleep), R (running), 
S (sleeping), T (traced or stopped) or Z (zombie)
%CPU – the share of cpu time used by the process 
since last update.
%MEM – share of physical memory used.
TIME+ – total cpu time used by the task in hundredths
of a second.
COMMAND – command name or command line 
(name + options) 




































==> 65 Understanding+Processes.txt <==
Understanding Processes: 

A process is a unit for provisioning system resources.
It is any program, application or command that runs on
the system.

A process is created in memory in its own address space
when a command, program or application is initiated.

Processes are organized in a hierarchial fashion.

Each process has a parent process a.k.a. a calling
process that spawns it.

A single parent process may have one or more child
processes and processes many of its attributes to
them when they are created.

Each process is assigned a unique identification number
knows as PID (Process identifier), which is used by the
kernel to manage and control the process through its
lifecycle.

Once the process is completed or terminated, this event
is reported back to its parent process and all the
resources assigned to it are then freed and the PID
is removed.

Several processes are started at system boot, many of
which sit in the memory and wait for an event to trigger
a request to use their services.

These background system processes are called daemons
and are critical for the system to operate.












==> 66 Listing+a+Specific+process.txt <==
Listing a specific process:

Linux (RHEL,Centos) offers the pidof and pgrep command
that only lists the PID of a specific process.

These commands have a few switches available to them.

However, their simplest use is to pass a process name
as an argument to view its PID.

For example:

- To list the PID of the crond daemon use:

#- pidof crond

or

#- pgrep crond

Also check with:

#- ps -eaf | grep crond


==> 67 View+Processes+by+User+and+group+ownership.txt <==
- View Processes by User and group ownership:

A process can be listed by its ownership or owning
group. 

We can use the ps command for this purpose.


For example: 

- To list all processes owned by root, specify the -U
option with the command and username: 

#- ps -U root


[root@centos ~]# ps -U root
  PID TTY          TIME CMD
    1 ?        00:00:04 systemd
    2 ?        00:00:00 kthreadd
    3 ?        00:00:01 ksoftirqd/0


This command lists PID, TTY, TIME and process name for
all processes owned by the root user.



-  We can also specify -G option and the name of an 
owning group to print processes associated only with 
that group.

Example: 

#- ps -G root













==> 68 Process+States.txt <==
Process States:

A process changes its operating state many times during
its life cycle.

Factors such as processor load, memory availability,
process priority and response from other apps affect
how often a process changes from one state to another.

Process could be in a non-running state for a while
or waiting on another process to provide information
so that it can continue to run.

- There are five basic process states: 

  - Running
  - Sleeping	
  - Waiting
  - Stopped
  - Zombie


- Running: 

The process is being executed by the system CPU.


- Sleeping: 

The process is waiting input from a user or another
process.


- Waiting: 

The process has received the input it was waiting for
and is now ready to run as soon as its turn arrives.


- Stopped: 

The process is currently halted and will not run even
when the turn arrives, unless a signal is sent to it
to change its behavior.


- Zombie: 

The process is dead. A zombie process exists in the
process table alongside other processes but it takes
up no resources. 

Its entry exists until the parent process permits it
to die. 

A zombie process is also called a defunct process.


- Check with top comand


















==> 69 What+is+process+Niceness.txt <==
Understanding process Niceness: 


Each process has an assigned priority, which is
established at initiation. It is based on a numeric
value called niceness (or a nice value).


There are 40 niceness values, with -20 being the 
highest and +19 being the lowest value.


Most processes started by the system use the default
niceness of 0. 


A process running at higher priority gets more CPU
attention.


A child process inherits the niceness of its parent or
calling process.

Normally, we run programs at the default niceness but
we can change it based on system load and urgency.
==> 70 Viewing+and+changing+process+Niceness.txt <==
Viewing and changing process Niceness:

We can view current process priorities and niceness
values with the ps command, the top command and the 
system monitor GUI. 

- You can use -l option to look for priority:

#- ps -l

F S   UID   PID  PPID  C PRI  NI ADDR SZ WCHAN  TTY


See column seven - PRI.

Priority is calculated based on the Niceness value,
column 8 - NI.




- Run the following command:

#- ps -efl

F S UID        PID  PPID  C PRI  NI ADDR SZ WCHAN  
4 S root         1     0  0  80   0 - 32042 ep_pol 
1 S root         2     0  0  80   0 -     0 kthrea 
1 S root         3     2  0  80   0 -     0 smpboo 
1 S root         5     2  0  60 -20 -     0 worker 

Above output indicates use of default niceness for
the first 3 processes and the highest niceness of
-20 for the fourth one. 

The values are used by the process scheduler to adjust
their execution time on the CPU.




- To check the default niceness:

#- nice

0 is default.



- Changing process niceness:

You can assign a different niceness to a program or a
command at its startup.

Example 1: 

- To run the top command at a lower priority with
nice value of +2:

#- nice -2 top

From another terminal you can check with:

#- ps -el | grep top




Example 2:

- To run the top command at a higher priority with
nice value of -10. 

Note:  Two dashes

#- nice --10 top


From another terminal you can check with:

#- ps -el | grep top


You will notice that the process is now running with a
higher priority 70 with a nice value of -10.
















==> 71 Renicing+a+running+process.txt <==
Renicing a running process: 

The niceness of a running process can be changed using
the renice command. 

Renicing will change the priority at which the process
is currently running.


Example: 

- To change the nice of a running top session from 
old priority to +5: 

1- find the PID of top 

#- pidof crond
642 (PID)

2- Change it to +5

#- renice 5 642

3- ps -el | grep top

Note: Options -u and -g can be used with renice to 
change nice values of processes owned by a user or
group members.
==> 72 Job+Scheduling.txt <==
Understanding Job scheduling: 

Job scheduling allows a user to submit a command or a
program for execution at a specified time in the
future.

The execution of the command or program could be one
time or recurring based on pre-determined time
schedule.

One time execution is normally scheduled for an 
activity that needs to performed at low system usage
times. For example, an execution of a lengthy shell
program.

In contrast, recurring activities may include backups,
deleting old log files, system monitoring tasks, 
running custom scripts and removing unwanted files.



- Job scheduling and execution is taken care of by two
daemons: 

- atd
- crond

atd: 

atd manages the jobs scheduled to run one time in the
future.
The atd daemon retires a missed job at the same time
next day.

- crond
crond manages recurring jobs at pre-specified times.
At startup, this daemon reads schedules in files 
located in the /var/spool/cron and /etc/cron.d
directories and loads them in the memory for later
execution.

This daemon run a job at its scheduled time only and
unlike atd daemon does not entertain missed jobs.

Note: 
Neither daemon needs to restart after any additions
or changes.


















==> 73 Control+Processes+with+signals.txt <==
Controlling Processes with Signals: 

A system may have hundreds or thousands of processes
running simultaneously on it. 

It is sometimes necessary to alert a process of an 
event.
We can accomplish that by send a control signal to the
process.


Processes can send a signal to alert each other as well

A process will halt its execution as soon as it gets
the signal and take appropriate action as per the 
enclosed instructions in that signal.


The signal can instruct the process to terminate
gracefully, kill it abruptly or force it to re-read
its configuration.


There are many signals available for use but we will
mostly deal with only a few of them.


Each signal is associated with a unique numeric 
identifier, a name and an action.

- List of available signals can be displayed by using
the kill  command with -l option:

#- kill -l


Examples:

1- SIGHUP: 

Hang up signal causes a process to disconnect itself 
from a closed terminal it was tied to.
Can also instruct a a running daemon to re-read its
configuration.

2- SIGINT: 

The ^c signal issued on the controlling terminal can
interrupt the execution of a process.

9- SIGKILL: 

Kills a process abruptly.

15- SIGTERM: 

Sends the signal to stop a process in an orderly way.
This is the default signal and can be ignored by a 
process.



Commands:

The commands kill and pkill are used to send a signal
to a process. Regular users can kill processes that 
they own and root user can kill any process.


- pkill: 
The pkill command needs process name(s) to send a 
signal to.

Examples: 
- To kill with default soft termination signal: 
#- pkill top

- To kill forcefully right away use:

#- pkill -9 top


- kill
The kill command needs PID(s) to send a signal.

Examples:

- To kill with default soft termination signal: 
#- kill top

- To kill forcefully right away use:

#- kill -9 top


- The command killall can be used to terminate all
processes that match provided criteria.

Example: 

#- killall top





















==> 74Controlling+user+access.txt <==
Controlling user access:

By default, all users have access to schedule jobs 
using the at and cron services.

The access can be restricted to specific users only.
Restrictions can be applied by adding users in the
allow or deny files in /etc directory.

For at, at.allow and at.deny files are used.
For cron, cron.allow and cron.deny files are used.

We can simply add user names to allow or deny files to
grant or deny access.


Note: 

By default, deny files exist and are empty and allow
files do not exist. This mean all users will have full
access to using both tools by default.



==> 75Scheduling+with+at+command.txt <==
Scheduling with at command: 

The at command is used to schedule a one-time job in
the future.

All submitted jobs are spooled in the /var/spool/at
directory and executed by atd daemon at specified time.

This file also includes the name of the command or
script to be run.

Ways of expressing a time with the at command: 

at 1:20am    =  Runs at next 1:20am
at noon	     =	Runs at 12pm
at 12:42     = 	Runs at 11:42pm
at midnight  = 	Runs at 12am
at 17:01 tomorrow  =  Runs at 5:01pm, next day.
at now + 7 hours  = Runs 7 hours from now
at 3:00 1/15/2019 = Runs at 3am on Jan 15, 2019



You can also supply a filename with at command using 
the -f option. This command will execute that file at
specified time.

Example: 

-To run a script script.sh from a user's home directory
3 hours from now: 

#- at -f /home/user/script.sh now + 3 hours

If at is not installed, you may have to install it.

Check if installed:
#- yum list installed at

To install: 
#- yum install at




















==> 76Submit,+view,+list+and+remove+an+at+job.txt <==
Submit, view, list and remove an at job:


Exerice:

1- Run the at command and specify the time and date
for the job execution.

# at 11:30pm 6/30/2019

at> find / -name core


2- List the job file created in /var/spool/at:

# ll /var/spool/at

ID 5 created for job


3- Display contents of this file:

# cat /var/spool/at/file
 
or

# at -c 5


4- List spooled job:

# at -l

or

# atq



5- Remove spooled job

# at -d 5

or

# atrm 5

This will remove the job file from /var/spool/at.
Can be confirmed with atq command as well.








==> 77Using+crontab.txt <==
Crontab:

Using crontab is another method of scheduling jobs to
in the future. 

Unlike, atd, crond executes cron jobs on a regular
basis as long as they comply with format defined in the
/etc/crontab file.

#- cat /etc/crontab

Crontables for users are located in the /var/spool/cron
directory. Each authorized user with a scheduled job
has a file matching their user name in this directory.

For example: 

The crontab file for User1 will be:
/var/spool/cron/user1 

Crontables are also stored in /etc/cron.d directory, 
only root user has access to create, modify and delete
them.

When daemon is done running the jobs at the specified 
time, it adds a log entry to /var/log/cron file.


- To check if cron is already installed:

# yum list installed | grep cron
  or
# rpm -qa | grep cron


Crontab command can be used with options:
-e = to edit
-l = to list
-r = remove crontables









==> 78Syntax+of+User+Crontab+Files.txt <==
Syntax of User Crontab Files:

The /etc/crontab file specifies the syntax that each
cron job must comply with.

# cat /etc/crontab

Field	Description	Allowed Value
MIN	Minute field	0 to 59
HOUR	Hour field	0 to 23
DOM	Day of Month	1-31
MON	Month field	1-12
DOW	Day Of Week	0-6
CMD	Command	Any command to be executed.



Example: 

- Scheduling a Job For a Specific Time
The basic usage of cron is to execute a job in a 
specific time as shown below. This will execute the 
Full backup shell script (full-backup) on 11th July 
at 09:30 AM.

Please note that the time field uses 24 hours format.
So, for 9 AM use 9, and for 9 PM use 21.

1- # crontab -e

2- Add the below line:

30 09 11 07 * /home/user1/full-backup

-------------------
30 – 30th Minute
09 – 09 AM
11 – 11th Day
07 – 7th Month (July)
* – Every day of the week
-------------------

==> 81 1-+Introduction+to+software+packages.txt <==
Introduction: 

Linux applications are called Packages. A software
package is a group of files organized in a directory
structure and metadata that makes up a software 
application. 


Files contained in a package include installable scripts
configuration files, library files, commands and the
related documentation. 


The Redhat software management system was originally
called Redhat Package Manager but is now known as RPM
Package Manager (RPM). 


We can use RPM to install, remove and manage packages.


Example:

# rpm -qa

# rpm -qa | grep ssh
==> 82 2-+Redhat+Subscription+Management+Service.txt <==
Redhat Subscription Management Service (RHSM): 

This is a service provided by Redhat. You first register
your systems with RHSM then attach subscriptions to them
based on the OS and and software they run.

Once registered through RHSM your system is entitled to
software updates, technical support and access to the 
supported software. 

Note: CentOS is the same thing as Redhat but without
the support from Redhat.


- Registering you system with RHSM: 

# subscription-manager register --auto-attach

Username
Password

System has been registered

Status: Subscribed



- Unregistering and unsubscribing your system with RHSM: 

# subscription-manager remove --all

# subscription-manager unregister

# subscription-manager clean
















==> 83c3-+Using+YUM+for+Managing+Software+Packages.txt <==
Managing Packages with yum: 

The yum (Yellowdog Updater Modified) is included with
RHEL/Fedora/CentOS for the management of software.

This utility requires that your system has access to a
software repository.



For Redhat: 
The Redhat Subscription Management Service grants your 
system access to software repositories but it is
restricted to subscribers only.

For CentOS:
Do not require a subscription and software repositories
are accessible to everyone. 


It allows you to install, update and remove software on
your system running RHEL, Fedora or and CentOS.

Main benefit of using the yum command is that it will
automatically resolve dependencies when you install
any software package.




Practical Examples:

1- To install specified package: 
# yum -y install <package name>
# yum install vsftpd (Very secure ftp Daemon)

-y = install without asking for confirmation


2- Remove a package: 
# yum remove vsftpd


3- Check which packages need to be updated on your 
system:
# yum check-update


4- Update all packages on your system:
# yum update


5- Search for packages:

# yum search vsftpd


6- Check for install package

# yum list installed | grep ssh



Managing package groups:

1- List available groups: 

# yum grouplist


2- Search specific package

# yum grouplist | grep -i server


2- Install group GNOME Desktop

# yum groupinstall GNOME Desktop


3- Remove installed group

# yum groupremove GNOME Desktop


4- To download a package in your current directory:

# yum install yum-utils
# yumdownloader -v vsftpd
# ls

5- Find info about a package
# yum info ntp



- View yum history:

1- To list last 20 transactions:

# yum history list

2- List history info
# yum history info

3- List all transactions: 
# yum history list all

















 





==> 84 - 4-+Using+RPM+for+Software+Package+Management.txt <==
RPM Package Manager:

RPM is designed to simplify the installation, querying 
and removing software in Linux environment.

It allows ease of updating existing packages and 
verification of packages.


RPM usage:

1- To check all installed packages: 

# rpm -qa
q = query 
a = all

2- To check a particular installed package:

# rpm -qa | grep ntp


3- To install a .rpm package

# cd /test
# ls
vsftpd-3.0.2-22.el7.x86_64.rpm

# rpm -ivh vsftpd-3.0.2-22.el7.x86_64.rpm
i = install
v = verbose
h = hash 


4- To upgrade a package:

# rpm -Uvh package name (can also install using this)


5- To remove a package:
# rpm -e vsftpd 


6- To Verify all or one rpm Package:

# rpm -Va 

or

# rpm -Va | grep ssh


7- To get information about a RPM package:

# rpm -qi ntp


8- Find the Location where files were copied:

# rpm -ql ntp

9- Determine which rpm a file came from:

# rpm -qf /var/lib/ntp/


10- Install an rpm from a website:

# rpm -Uvh  http://pkgs.repoforge.org/......   .rpm




































==> 85Run+Levels.txt <==
Runlevel: 

Determines the state of a system and controls how one
can login, what services and scripts should run when a 
system starts.  

Defaults runlevels vary from distro to distro, as do the
default settings in each run level.

Below are the run levels for Redhat/CentOS 6.

Note: Redhat/CentOS 7 uses Targets.


Runlevel are defined from 0 – 6: 

- Runlevel 0 – Shut down the system 
(do not make it default)

- Runlevel 1 – single mode

- Runlevel 2 – multiuser mode without networking
(no NFS support)

- Runlevel 3 – multiuser without "X" (command line)
(Most commonly used - recommended for servers)

- Runlevel 4- Not used

- Runlevel 5 – X11 (GUI)
(Good for end-user systems, NOT recommended for Servers)


- Runlevel 6 – Reboots the system
Do not set inittab value to runlevel6.



Other Distros: 

Debian and Ubuntu also has 7 runlevels. 0, 1 and 6 are 
the same as Redhat. 
Runlevels 2 throuh five are identical but can be 
configured in whatever way you desire.
Default is run level 2 but it is configured as a full
multi-user mode with graphics (X windows).



- View current runlevel: 

# runlevel

- To change current runlevel
# init runlevel  (init 6 will reboot)

Modify /etc/inittab file and change default level. 






















==> 86 Targets.txt <==
Targets:

Systemd has replaced sysVinit as the default service 
manager in RHEL 7. Some of the sysVinit commands have
been symlinked to their RHEL 7 counterparts, however 
this will eventually be deprecated in favor of the 
standard systemd commands in the future.

Systemd uses Targets instead of the runlevels.


- Each Runlevel Target file is a symbolic link to the
system-start Target equivalents. For example:

# cd /usr/lib/systemd/system
# ls -l runlevel*




Comapring runlevel with Target: 

Runlevel 0 – shut down the system
Runlevel 1 – single mode
Runlevel 2 – multiuser mode without networking
Runlevel 3 – multiuser with text login screen
Runlevel 4- customized runlevel (not in use)
Runlevel 5 – runlevel 3 with graphical login
Runlevel 6 – Reboots the system


Targets: 

0- runlevel 0.target, poweroff.target 
System halt/shutdown

1- runlevel1.target, rescue.target
Single-user mode (rescue mode)

2- runlevel2.target
User-defined/Site-specific runlevels. By default, 
identical to 3.

3- runlevel3.target, multi-user.target
Multi-user, non-graphical mode, command line

4-  runlevel4.target
User-defined/Site-specific runlevels. By default, 
identical to 3.

5- runlevel5.target, graphical.target
Multi-user, graphical mode

==> 88 1-+Linux+Server+Security.txt <==
Introduction:

In this section we will cover things we can do to make
your server more secure.

Keep in mind there is no such thing as 100% secure
system and that is why you want to include regular
backups and auditing as part of your security plan.

If your server is connected to the internet there is
always a possibility that its security can be compromised
so the idea behind security is to minimize the attacks
on our system as much as possible.

If your security is tight then an attacker may move on
to an easier target.


- Below are things you want to implement and consider when
planning your system's security:


- Physical Security

- Keep the software up to date
# yum update

- Employ the Principle of Least Privilege

- Use Encryption

- Avoid Non-Secure Protocols

- Clean up your systems
# rpm -qa > /tmp/installedpackages.txt

- Minimize number of services per system

- Enfore a good password policy
# chage
# /etc/login.defs

- Disable root login
# /etc/ssh/sshd_config

- Disable Unneeded Services
# chkconfig  --list   (RHEL 6)
# systemctl list-unit-files (RHEL 7)

- Delete X Windows
# yum groupremove "X Windows System"

- Implement a Firewall
# firewalld daemon for RHEL 7 and iptables
Covered in detail in the Firewall section.

==> 90 Managing+Storage+with+parted.txt <==
- Managing Storage with parted

The parted tool is used to carve up disks on RHEL/CentOS 
systems.

This text based program allows us to view, add, check,
modify, copy, resize and delete partitions.

Parted understands and supports both MBR and GPT
schemes.

- MBR (Master boot record): Used by BIOS-based systems
- GPT (GUID partition table): Used by UEFI-based systems



Practical Use: 

- Use the parted command to see all options
# parted

- Type help to see list of subcommands
# help

- q or quit to quit.
# q 


- Create an MBR partition Table and a Partition:

# lsblk (To see the disk)

# parted /dev/sdb

# print (view current partition info)

# mklabel msdos

# mkpart primary 1 100M

# print

# quit or q

Note: Run partprobe command if the disk had any 
partitions previously. Not needed for new and
unpartitioned disks

- To confirm:
# parted /dev/sdb print
or
# grep sdb /proc/partitions



- Delete an MBR partition

# parted /dev/sdb
# print
# rm 1
# print
# q

- To confirm:
# parted /dev/sdb print
or
# grep sdb /proc/partitions


























==> 91 Managing+Storage+with+gdisk.txt <==

The gdisk utility is used to carve up disks using GPT
format.

This text based (menu driven) program allows us to
view, add, verify, modify and delete partitions among
other tasks.

It can be used to create upto 128 partitions on a single
GPT disk on systems with UEFI firmware.

Note: Skip if you don't have UEFI system.
Error: Found invalid GPT and valid MBR; converting MBR
to GPT format.




- Practical Use: 

# gdisk /dev/sdb
# ? (To list sub-commands)
# q (To quit)


- Create a GPT Partition Table and a Partition:

# gdisk /dev/sdb
# o (Labels the disk to use GPT scheme)
# y (yes)
# p (To view disk label)

- Create a 100 MB partition:
# n (Create a partition)
Use all defaults except for size)
# +200M

- Verify 
# p
- Write and save changes
# w 
# y (yes)


Note: Use partprobe if the disk had some partitions 
previously.

- Confirm the partition information:

# gdisk -l /dev/sdb
or
# grep sdb /proc/partitions


- To delete a GPT Partitions: 

# gdisk /dev/sdb
# p (view current partition table)
# d1 (delete partition number 1)

==> 92LVM.txt <==
LVM (Logical Volume Manager):

The LVM solution is widely used for managing disk
storage.

Managing disk space has always been a significant 
and time consuming task for system adminstrators.

Running out of disk space used to be the start of a
long and complex series of tasks to increase the space 
available to a disk partition. It also required taking 
the system off-line. This usually involved installing a 
new hard drive, booting to recovery or single-user mode,
creating a partition and a filesystem on the new hard 
drive, using temporary mount points to move the data 
from the too-small filesystem to the new, larger one,
changing the content of the /etc/fstab file to reflect
the correct device name for the new partition, and 
rebooting to remount the new filesystem on the 
correct mount point.


LVM allows for very flexible disk space management. 
It provides features like the ability to add disk space
to a logical volume and its filesystem while that 
filesystem is mounted and active and it allows for the 
collection of multiple physical hard drives and 
partitions into a single volume group which can then be
divided into logical volumes.


Structure:

-Physical Hard drive
  - PV (Physical Volume)
     - VG (Volume Group)
	- LV (Logical Volume)
	    - Filesystem 



Practical Use:

- Create a Physical Volume:
# lsblk (To check available disks)


- Create a PV (Physical Volume)
# pvcreate /dev/sdb

- Confirm
# pvs


Create a VG (Volume Group)called test_vg on sdb
# vgcreate test_vg /dev/sdb

- To Check
# vgs
or
# vgdisplay


- Create a Logical Volume called example_lv on test_vg
Volume Group - Size of 50 MB:

- lvcreate -n example_lv -L 50M test_vg

- Check
# lvs
or
# lvdisplay /dev/test_vg/example_lv


To be able to use and mount this LV

- Create a ext3 Filesystem:

# mkfs.ext3 /dev/test_vg/example_lv


To mount this LV on a directory /tmp/example:

- Make a directory under /tmp
# mkdir example

Now mount the LV:

#  mount /dev/test_vg/example_lv /tmp/example

- Check 
# df -h

Note: This is not permanent, to make this permanent
you need to add this entry in /etc/fstab:

# /dev/mapper/test_vg-example_lv  /tmp/example ext3
defaults 1 2


Extend a Volume Group and Logical Volume:


- Add disk or use existing VG if space is available:
# pvcreate /dev/sdc
# vgextend test_vg /dev/sdc

- Check 
# vgs


- Extend a Logical Volume:

# lvextend -L 100M /dev/test_vg/example_test

Check:
#df -h
Size has not changed yet.

- Run the followinf command:
# resize2fs /dev/test_vg/example_lv

- Check again
# df -h

Success.



 To remove LV, VG and PV:

- To Remove a Logical Volume:
# unmount /tmp/exampe
# lvremove -f /dev/test_vg/example_lv


- To Remove a Volume Group:

# vgs
# vgremove test_vg

Check:
# vgs


- To remove a Physical Volume:

# pvs
# pvremove /dev/sdb

Check:
# pvs

# lsblk

==> 93 Network+Components.txt <==
Basic Network components you must know:

IP Address
Subnet Mask
Gateway
Static vs DHCP
Ethernet and Virtual Interface
MAC Address


IP Address:
An Internet Protocol address is a numerical label 
assigned to each device connected to a computer network
that uses the Internet Protocol for communication.

Most networks today, including all computers on the 
Internet, use the TCP/IP protocol as the standard for 
how to communicate on the network. In the TCP/IP 
protocol, the unique identifier for a computer is 
called its IP address.

There are two standards for IP addresses: IP Version 4 
(IPv4) and IP Version 6 (IPv6). All computers and 
networked devices with IP addresses have an IPv4 address
and many are starting to use the new IPv6 address system
as well.

IPv4:

IPv4 uses 32 binary bits to create a single unique 
address on the network. An IPv4 address is expressed by
four numbers separated by dots.
Example: 192.168.123.132

Each number represents eight-digit binary number, also 
called an octet.
These eight bit sections are known as octets. 
The example IP address, then, becomes 
11000000.10101000.01111011.10000100
192     .168     .123     . 132 

IPv6:

When the Internet exploded, IPv6 was created as it was
realized that we may run out of IPv4 addresses.
IPv6 uses 128 binary bits to create a single unique 
address on the network. 
An IPv6 address is expressed by eight groups of 
hexadecimal numbers separated by colons:

2001:cdba:0000:0000:0000:0000:3257:9652

Groups of numbers that contain all zeros are often 
omitted to save space:

2001:cdba::3257:9652



- Subnet Mask and subnetting:

The practice of dividing a network into two or more 
networks is called subnetting.

For IPv4, a network may also be characterized by its 
subnet mask or netmask.
For example: 255.255.255.0 is the subnet mask for the 
prefix 198.51.100.0/24.


- Gateway:
A gateway is a network node that connects two networks
using different protocols together. While a bridge is 
used to join two similar types of networks, a gateway is
used to join two different networks.

Common Gateway is your home modem or your router.



- Static IP vs DHCP or Dynamic IP:

A Static IP address is a dedicated IP address that does
not change. This is an IP address that is used by your 
system every time you log in to the network. 
DHCP or Dynamic is an IP address that will automatically
be chosen for you from a pool of IP addresses that are 
assigned in the DHCP scope available on your network.
Think Static as permanent and DHCP as temporary IP.



Ethernet and Virtual Interface

- Ethernet Interface:

This usally the NIC (Network Interface card) that is on
that back of your computer a.k.a. NIC Card.

- Virtual Interface:

Very common now in Virtual environments such as Oracle
VM virtualbox, VMWare etc. 
Virtual interfaces exist only in software; there are no
physical elements. You identify an individual virtual 
interface using a numerical ID after the virtual 
interface name such as eth0.


MAC address:

Every NIC virtual or physical has a hardware address 
that's known as a MAC.
MAC stands for Media Access Control, and each identifier
is intended to be unique to a particular device.

A MAC address consists of six sets of two characters, 
each separated by a colon:

Example:

00:1B:44:11:3A:B7


















==> 94 The+OSI+model.txt <==
The OSI Model:

Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model, a conceptual 
framework that describes the functions of a networking 
or telecommunication system.

The model uses layers to help give a visual description 
of what is going on with a particular networking system.
This helps network administrators narrow down problems
physical or application related.


- OSI model consists of 7 Layers:

7- Application
6- Presentation
5- Session
4- Transport
3- Network
2- Data link
1- Physical


- Layer 7- Application:

Applications that work at Layer 7 are the ones that 
users interact with directly. 

Example:
Internet Explorer, Firefox, Skype, Outlook, Office etc


- Layer 6- Presentation:

it represents the preparation or translation of 
application format to network format.

Examples:

JPEG, GIF, MIDI etc.
Another  good example of this layer is encryption and 
decryption of data for secure transmission.



- Layer 5- Session:

Manages connection between local and remote application.
Handles application session management.

Example:

SQL, NFS etc.



- Layer 4- Transport:

The Transport Layer deals with the coordination of the 
data transfer between end systems and hosts. How much 
data to send, at what rate, where it goes, etc.

Examples:

TCP, UDP, Apple Talk etc.


- Layer 3- Network: 

This layer is is responsible for packet forwarding, 
including routing through different routers.
Determines how data gets from one system to another.

Examples: 

IP, Traceroute, PING, ARP etc



- Layer 2- Data Link:

The Data Link Layer provides node-to-node data transfer
(between two directly connected nodes), and also handles
error correction from the physical layer. 

Two sublayers exist here as well - the Media Access 
Control (MAC) layer and the Logical Link Control (LLC) 
layer. In the networking world, most switches operate at
Layer 2.

Examples:

Switches, Bridges, Ethernet etc.



- Layer 1- Physical:

This layer conveys the bit stream across the network 
either electrically, mechanically or through radio waves
The physical layer covers a variety of devices and 
mediums, among them cabling, connectors, receivers, 
transceivers and repeaters.



Memorizing Layers:

All People Seem To Need Data Processing.

7- Application - All
6- Presentation - People
5- Session - Seem
4- Transport - To
3- Network - Need
2- Data link - Data
1- Physical - Processing
















==> 95 Network+files+and+commands.txt <==
Network Adapter Files:

Network interface configuration files are located in the
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts directory.

# cd /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-

- You can use ip addr command to display your available 
network interfaces.
Older systems you can use ifconfig.

# ip addr
# ifconfig

- Find your hostname or servername:

# hostname
or 
# hostnamectl

# cat /etc/hostname	


- To /View Edit IP for hostname:

# cat /etc/hosts


- To View Change your DNS name:

# cat /etc/resolv.conf
Shows your Router address if home network - via ISP.
8.8.8.8 is Google's name server.


- To bring your Interface up and down
# ifup eth0 or enp0s3
# ifdown eth0 or enp0s3


- Ping

PING (Packet INternet Groper) command is the best way to
test connectivity between two nodes. Whether it is Local
Area Network (LAN) or Wide Area Network (WAN). 
Ping uses ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) to 
communicate to other devices.

Example:

# ping google.com

or 
- Ping with -c option exit after N number of request.

# ping -c 3 google.com



- traceroute Command: 

traceroute is a network troubleshooting utility which 
shows number of hops taken to reach destination also 
determine packets traveling path. 

Example

- trace google.com

# traceroute google.com




- Netstat (Network Statistic):

Netstat command displays connection info, routing table 
information etc. To displays routing table information 
use option as -r.

# netstat -r



- Route command

Shows default routing table in Linux

# route





















==> 96 NIC+Bonding.txt <==
NIC Bonding:

- Configure Interface Bonding with NetworkManager CLI:

1- Add two new interfaces 

Watch Video on how to: 
"Add a Network Adapter through Oracle VM Virtual Box"

2- Check status of NetworkManager Service:

# systemctl status NetworkManager

3- List all available network interfaces:

# nmcli dev status
enp0s8
enp0s9
4- Load bonding driver in Kernel:

# modprobe bonding


5- Verify:

# modinfo bonding

6- Add logical Interface "bond0" with load balancing
policy "round-robin", IP 192.168.1.120/24 and
gateway 192.168.1.1: 

# nmcli con add type bond con-name bond0 ifname bond0
mode balance-rr \ip4 192.168.1.120/24 gw4 192.168.1.1

Check file:
#  cat /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-bond0

- Add two added interfaces as slaves:

Add 1st Interface enp0s8
# nmcli con add type bond-slave ifname enp0s8 master
bond0

Add 2nd Interface
# nmcli con add type bond-slave ifname enp0s9 master
bond0

Check Files: 
# cat 
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-bond-slave-enp0s8
and 
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-bond-slave-enp0s9

- Activate bond0
# nmcli con up bond0

-  Show connection info for bond and slaves:
# nmcli con show | egrep 'bond0|enp0s8|enp0s9'

# reboot
